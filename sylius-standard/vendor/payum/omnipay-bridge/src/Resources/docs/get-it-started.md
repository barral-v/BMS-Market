# Get it started.

In this chapter we are going to talk about the most common task: purchase of a product using [Omnipay](https://github.com/omnipay/omnipay).
We assume you already read [get it started](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Core/Resources/docs/get-it-started.md) from core.
Here we just show you modifications you have to put to the files shown there.

## Installation

The preferred way to install the library is using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
Run composer require to add dependencies to _composer.json_:

```bash
php composer.phar require "payum/omnipay-bridge:*@stable"
```

## config.php

We have to only add a the payment factory. All the rest remain the same:

```php
<?php
//config.php

// ...

// direct payment like Stripe or Authorize.Net

$directOmnipayFactory = new Payum\OmnipayBridge\DirectPaymentFactory();
$payments['stripe_omnipay'] = $directOmnipayFactory->create(array(
    'type' => 'Stripe',
    'options' => array('apiKey' => 'REPLACE IT', 'testMode' => true),
));


// or offsite payment like Paypal ExpressCheckout

$offsiteOmnipayFactory = new Payum\OmnipayBridge\OffsitePaymentFactory();
$payments['paypal_omnipay'] = $offsiteOmnipayFactory->create(array(
    'type' => 'PayPal_Express',
    'options' => array(
        'username' => 'REPLACE IT', 
        'password' => 'REPLACE IT',
        'signature' => 'REPLACE IT',
        'testMode' => true
    ),
));
```

## prepare.php

Here you have to modify a `paymentName` value. Set it to `stripe_omnipay` or `paypal_omnipay` or any other you configure.
