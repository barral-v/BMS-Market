# Checkout.

In this chapter we are going to talk about the most common task: purchase of a product using [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout).
We assume you already read [get it started](https://github.com/Payum/Payum/blob/master/src/Payum/Core/Resources/docs/get-it-started.md) from core.
Here we just show you modifications you have to put to the files shown there.

## Installation

The preferred way to install the library is using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/).
Run composer require to add dependencies to _composer.json_:

```bash
php composer.phar require payum/stripe
```

## config.php

We have to only add the payment factory. All the rest remain the same:

```php
<?php
//config.php

// ..

$stripeCheckoutFactory = new \Payum\Stripe\CheckoutPaymentFactory();
$payments['stripe_checkout'] = $stripeJsFactory->create(array(
    'publishable_key' => 'EDIT IT', 'secret_key' => 'EDIT IT'
));
```

## prepare.php

Here you have to modify a `paymentName` value. Set it to `stripe_checkout`.
